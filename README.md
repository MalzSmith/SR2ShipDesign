# SR2ShipDesign
My attempt at making the ai ship designs in Star Ruler 2 more viable

## Features
* More armor on randomly generated designs
* No armor on AI generated scouts
* More control cores on randomly generated flagships
* No backwards facing lazers/muons/etc
* AI generates more random designs when picking one to use
* AI takes important exposed systems more seriously when evaluating ship designs

## Installation
Copy the `Better AI Ships` folder under your Star Ruler 2 mods (if you are using the Steam version on windows, this should be located under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Ruler 2\mods`).

Alternatively use the [SR2 Mod Manager](https://github.com/DaloLorn/SR2ModManager) to install the mod.
